Welcome to the **LibTiff.Net** library. 

LibTiff.Net is the .NET  library for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data. 

The library does **not** rely on GDI, GDI+ or any other imaging technologies of the .NET Framework and Windows OS. 

This library comes in two versions: 
* for .NET 4 and newer
* for .NET Standard 2.0 and newer

There is also a small collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of TIFF.

If you are new to the LibTiff.Net, see the [Getting Started](~/articles/KB/getting-started.html) topic to get familiar with the library and set up your project for reading and writing TIFF.

The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of your needs for reading and writing TIFF images.
