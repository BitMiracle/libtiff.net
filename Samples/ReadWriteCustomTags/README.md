This sample shows how to read and write custom TIFF tags.Custom tags are tags unknown to the library. However, they may be read from a file or written to a file without problems. Special "extender callback" method should be used to instruct the library about format, names and other properties of such tags.This sample shows how to create "extender callback" method, register that method with the library and use Tiff.MergeFieldInfo to merge description of your custom tags with other tags description. After that custom tags can be read or written as usual.
