This sample shows how to copy contents of an existing TIFF image to a new one.

Code that can copy contents of an arbitrary TIFF file to another one is too complex to be used as a sample. This sample contains a simple code that shows basics you can start from. It works for stripped images.

For more advanced code you may want to look at the TiffCP utility source code. TiffCP is designed to copy contents of an arbitrary TIFF file to another one.
