This sample shows how to read RGB value of any pixel in a TIFF image.

The library provides methods that can decode almost any TIFF image and return array of packed RGBA values for its samples (pixels). This sample shows how to use  Tiff.ReadRGBAImage method to get packed sample values and Tiff.GetA/GetB/GetG/GetR to unpack individual components of an RGBA value.
