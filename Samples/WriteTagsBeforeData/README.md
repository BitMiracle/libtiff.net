This sample shows how to create a TIFF image with its tags saved before the image data.

By default, LibTiff.Net saves TIFF tags after the image data but some application or firmware
require TIFF images to have their tags saved before the image data.

For example, Cisco routers require TIFF files with tags saved before the data (so called Cisco TIFF File Format).
