This sample shows how to convert black and white TIFF image to a System.Drawing.Bitmap.At first, this sample reads important TIFF fields like width, height, samples per pixel, etc. then reads scanlines of an image using Tiff.ReadScanline method in a loop. Note, that there are other Tiff.Read* methods provided by the library.To convert opened TIFF image to a System.Drawing.Bitmap this sample creates Bitmap with the size of the original TIFF image and then uses combination of Bitmap.LockBits, Marshal.Copy and Bitmap.UnlockBits methods for each scanline.
