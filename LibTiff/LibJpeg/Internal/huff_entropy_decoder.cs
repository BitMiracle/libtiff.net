/*
 * This file contains Huffman entropy decoding routines.
 * Both sequential and progressive modes are supported in this single module.
 *
 * Much of the complexity here has to do with supporting input suspension.
 * If the data source module demands suspension, we want to be able to back
 * up to the start of the current MCU.  To do this, we copy state variables
 * into local working storage, and update them back to the permanent
 * storage only upon successful completion of an MCU.
