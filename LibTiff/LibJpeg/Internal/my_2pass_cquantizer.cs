/*
 * This file contains 2-pass color quantization (color mapping) routines.
 * These routines provide selection of a custom color map for an image,
 * followed by mapping of the image to that color map, with optional
 * Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 * It is also possible to use just the second pass to map to an arbitrary
 * externally-given color map.
 *
 * Note: ordered dithering is not supported, since there isn't any fast
 * way to compute intercolor distances; it's unclear that ordered dither's
 * fundamental assumptions even hold with an irregularly spaced color map.

    /// This module implements the well-known Heckbert paradigm for color
    /// quantization.  Most of the ideas used here can be traced back to
    /// Heckbert's seminal paper
    /// Heckbert, Paul.  "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display",
    /// Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
    /// 
    /// In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
    /// usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
    /// size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
    /// 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
    /// in the same histogram cell.
    /// 
    /// Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
    /// color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
    /// have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
    /// remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
    /// 
    /// The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
    /// color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
    /// This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
    /// considerable care.
    /// 
    /// Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
    /// the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
    /// used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
    /// may yet be found.
    /// 
    /// In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
    /// space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
    /// This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
    /// entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
    /// useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
    /// and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
    /// externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
    /// The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
    /// 
    /// To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
    /// RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
    /// B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
    /// The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
    /// weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
    /// If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
    /// probably need to change these scale factors.
    /// 
    /// First we have the histogram data structure and routines for creating it.
    /// 
    /// The number of bits of precision can be adjusted by changing these symbols.
    /// We recommend keeping 6 bits for G and 5 each for R and B.
    /// If you have plenty of memory and cycles, 6 bits all around gives marginally
    /// better results; if you are short of memory, 5 bits all around will save
    /// some space but degrade the results.
    /// To maintain a fully accurate histogram, we'd need to allocate a "long"
    /// (preferably unsigned long) for each cell.  In practice this is overkill;
    /// we can get by with 16 bits per cell.  Few of the cell counts will overflow,
    /// and clamping those that do overflow to the maximum value will give close-
    /// enough results.  This reduces the recommended histogram size from 256Kb
    /// to 128Kb, which is a useful savings on PC-class machines.
    /// (In the second pass the histogram space is re-used for pixel mapping data;
    /// in that capacity, each cell must be able to store zero to the number of
    /// desired colors.  16 bits/cell is plenty for that too.)
    /// Since the JPEG code is intended to run in small memory model on 80x86
    /// machines, we can't just allocate the histogram in one chunk.  Instead
    /// of a true 3-D array, we use a row of pointers to 2-D arrays.  Each
    /// pointer corresponds to a C0 value (typically 2^5 = 32 pointers) and
    /// each 2-D array has 2^6*2^5 = 2048 or 2^6*2^6 = 4096 entries.  Note that
    /// on 80x86 machines, the pointer row is in near memory but the actual
    /// arrays are in far memory (same arrangement as we use for image arrays).
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Declarations for Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
    /// 
    /// Errors are accumulated into the array fserrors[], at a resolution of
    /// 1/16th of a pixel count.  The error at a given pixel is propagated
    /// to its not-yet-processed neighbors using the standard F-S fractions,
    ///     ... (here)  7/16
    /// 3/16    5/16    1/16
    /// We work left-to-right on even rows, right-to-left on odd rows.
    /// 
    /// We can get away with a single array (holding one row's worth of errors)
    /// by using it to store the current row's errors at pixel columns not yet
    /// processed, but the next row's errors at columns already processed.  We
    /// need only a few extra variables to hold the errors immediately around the
    /// current column.  (If we are lucky, those variables are in registers, but
    /// even if not, they're probably cheaper to access than array elements are.)
    /// 
    /// The fserrors[] array has (#columns + 2) entries; the extra entry at
    /// each end saves us from special-casing the first and last pixels.
    /// Each entry is three values long, one value for each color component.

         * These routines are concerned with the time-critical task of mapping input
         * colors to the nearest color in the selected colormap.
         *
         * We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a
         * cache for the results of nearest-color searches.  All colors within a
         * histogram cell will be mapped to the same colormap entry, namely the one
         * closest to the cell's center.  This may not be quite the closest entry to
         * the actual input color, but it's almost as good.  A zero in the cache
         * indicates we haven't found the nearest color for that cell yet; the array
         * is cleared to zeroes before starting the mapping pass.  When we find the
         * nearest color for a cell, its colormap index plus one is recorded in the
         * cache for future use.  The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap
         * when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
         *
         * Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
         * sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
         * calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
         * Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
         * the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
         * be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
         * distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
         * fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
         * distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
         * it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
         * cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
         * The work array elements have to be ints, so the work array would need
         * 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
         *
         * To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
         * nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
         * The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
         * problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
         * referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
         * fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
         * approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
         * eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
         * three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
         * and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
         * The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
         * small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
         * can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
         * size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
         *
         * Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
         * faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
         * cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
         * useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
         * with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
         * refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
         * it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.
