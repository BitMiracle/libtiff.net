    /// <summary>
    /// Main buffer control (downsampled-data buffer)
    /// 
    /// In the current system design, the main buffer need never be a full-image
    /// buffer; any full-height buffers will be found inside the coefficient or
    /// postprocessing controllers.  Nonetheless, the main controller is not
    /// trivial.  Its responsibility is to provide context rows for upsampling/
    /// rescaling, and doing this in an efficient fashion is a bit tricky.
    /// 
    /// Postprocessor input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
    /// is defined to be (v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size)
    /// sample rows of each component.  (We require DCT_scaled_size values to be
    /// chosen such that these numbers are integers.  In practice DCT_scaled_size
    /// values will likely be powers of two, so we actually have the stronger
    /// condition that DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size is an integer.)
    /// Upsampling will typically produce max_v_samp_factor pixel rows from each
    /// row group (times any additional scale factor that the upsampler is
    /// applying).
    /// 
    /// The coefficient controller will deliver data to us one iMCU row at a time;
    /// each iMCU row contains v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size sample rows, or
    /// exactly min_DCT_scaled_size row groups.  (This amount of data corresponds
    /// to one row of MCUs when the image is fully interleaved.)  Note that the
    /// number of sample rows varies across components, but the number of row
    /// groups does not.  Some garbage sample rows may be included in the last iMCU
    /// row at the bottom of the image.
    /// 
    /// Depending on the vertical scaling algorithm used, the upsampler may need
    /// access to the sample row(s) above and below its current input row group.
    /// The upsampler is required to set need_context_rows true at global selection
    /// time if so.  When need_context_rows is false, this controller can simply
    /// obtain one iMCU row at a time from the coefficient controller and dole it
    /// out as row groups to the postprocessor.
    /// 
    /// When need_context_rows is true, this controller guarantees that the buffer
    /// passed to postprocessing contains at least one row group's worth of samples
    /// above and below the row group(s) being processed.  Note that the context
    /// rows "above" the first passed row group appear at negative row offsets in
    /// the passed buffer.  At the top and bottom of the image, the required
    /// context rows are manufactured by duplicating the first or last real sample
    /// row; this avoids having special cases in the upsampling inner loops.
    /// 
    /// The amount of context is fixed at one row group just because that's a
    /// convenient number for this controller to work with.  The existing
    /// upsamplers really only need one sample row of context.  An upsampler
    /// supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row
    /// group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that.
    /// (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly
    /// by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at
    /// the upsample step needn't be much less than one.)
    /// 
    /// To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups
    /// of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row.  (The last row group
    /// can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context,
    /// and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.)
    /// We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but
    /// that'd be very slow.  We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather
    /// strange pointer structure.  Here's how it works.  We allocate a workspace
    /// consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number
    /// of row groups per iMCU row).  We create two sets of redundant pointers to
    /// the workspace.  Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized
    /// pointer lists look like this:
    ///                   M+1                          M-1
    ///                   master pointer --> 0         master pointer --> 0
    ///                   1                            1
    ///                   ...                          ...
    ///                   M-3                          M-3
    ///                   M-2                           M
    ///                   M-1                          M+1
    ///                    M                           M-2
    ///                   M+1                          M-1
    ///                    0                            0
    /// We read alternate iMCU rows using each master pointer; thus the last two
    /// row groups of the previous iMCU row remain un-overwritten in the workspace.
    /// The pointer lists are set up so that the required context rows appear to
    /// be adjacent to the proper places when we pass the pointer lists to the
    /// upsampler.
    /// 
    /// The above pictures describe the normal state of the pointer lists.
    /// At top and bottom of the image, we diddle the pointer lists to duplicate
    /// the first or last sample row as necessary (this is cheaper than copying
    /// sample rows around).
    /// 
    /// This scheme breaks down if M less than 2, ie, min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  In that
    /// situation each iMCU row provides only one row group so the buffering logic
    /// must be different (eg, we must read two iMCU rows before we can emit the
    /// first row group).  For now, we simply do not support providing context
    /// rows when min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  That combination seems unlikely to
    /// be worth providing --- if someone wants a 1/8th-size preview, they probably
    /// want it quick and dirty, so a context-free upsampler is sufficient.
